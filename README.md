# js-algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey in JavaScript! This repository is a collection of algorithm problems I find useful and their solutions. It's a result of my dedication to mastering algorithms, problem-solving, and optimizing code.

This folder is for private use as a reference for myself, to show people what I am working on, and to brush up on my DSA knowledge in the future.

Throughout this journey, I will be exploring various algorithmic techniques, diving deep into data structures, and learning how to tackle complex coding challenges. My ultimate goal is to enhance my programming skills and contribute to the coding community.

I will be udpdating this folder and its README page when/as needed based on my personal progression.
