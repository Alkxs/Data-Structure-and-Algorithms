// Definition

Graph traversal is the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. 

// Classification

Look at previous sections as well

* Depth-First Search (DFS): following a single path as far as possible

* Breadth-First Search (BFS): all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Difference with trees is that there is not always a clear path.
