// Definition

A non-linear data structure that is a collection of nodes and connections.
All nodes are treated equally, there is no parent and no priority

// Usage

* Physical systems of roads, flights etc.
* Social networks (linkedin connection)
* Location / Mapping
* recommendation engines

// Terminology 

* Vertex = a node
* Edge = connection between nodes

// Type of graphs

* weighted / Unweighted = assigning values to edges (km in maps) or without 
* Directed / Undirected = with directions (linkedin) or without(facebook)

// Operations

* Add Vertex
* Add edges
* Display vertex

// Graph representation

* Adjacency list: array of lists

* Adjacency matrix : 2D array of size V x V (vertex), if edge the value is 1, otherwise is 0

// Implementation

// Big O
